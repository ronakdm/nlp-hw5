# nlp-hw5

This repo contains code for A4 of Natural Language Processing. The assignment is to apply the
Byte-Pair Encoding algorithm infer types from a training set.

## System Requirements

The code runs in a Python 3 environment with access to `jupyter`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`. The full
algorithm was run an on `attu` machine overnight, so it could take minutes or hours on advanced hardware.

## Instructions

Run the notebook `A5_p2.ipynb` from start to finish to run the algorithm on `A5-data.txt`, plot
the sequence length versus the vocabulary size, and encode a new word. The write-up answering questions from Problem 2 of A5 can be found in `writeup.pdf`. To look deeper into the implementation with comments,
see `bpe.py`.
